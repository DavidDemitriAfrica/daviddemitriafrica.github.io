<h1>Research</h1>

<p>Below is all my currently published research work. Each entry includes a link to the paper, a short summary, and some personal thoughts.</p>

<div class="research-entry">
    <h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0166785" target="_blank">Lag and Duration of Leaderâ€“Follower Relationships in Mixed Traffic Using Causal Inference</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper implements a causal inference approach to analyze leader-follower dynamics in an arterial road in Chennai, India. We quantify the temporal lag and duration of interactions using transfer entropy metrics.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> This was my first paper. I learned a lot about how to write research in general from here, and in the future I think I would like to do more papers in this style-- analyzing some weird real world phenomenon with an interesting method. Published in Chaos.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.14911" target="_blank">Batayan: A Filipino NLP benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models
</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Batayan, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on NLP tasks in Filipino.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Most of the work here was in actually writing/re-translating the entries. Would be nice to do some in-depth error analysis ala 
Parser Showdown at the Wall Street Corral. Published in ACL 2025 Main Conference</p>
